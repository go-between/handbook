# Introduction

Just before we got started with Go Between, Harrison had spent some time pondering what he wanted his life and career to look like.  He wrote the following document as we were thinking about Go Between, and after a bit of collaborative revision, our company was born.

# Software Partnership Pitch

**Core Idea**: I recently came to the following realizations about myself:

- _People are the Priority_: The people I choose to work in direct contact with on a daily basis have the most significant impact on the level of enjoyment and sense of satisfaction I receive from my work. This noticeably exceeds the impact of other factors, such as the technologies I’m working with, the product I’m working on, the process I’m working within, or the level of success achieved.
- _Enjoy the Ride_: I will spend tens of thousands of hours, over the course of the rest of my life, developing software. My desire is to enjoy this time and these experiences to the fullest, rather than optimizing for success, notoriety, compensation, or an early retirement.

**The Pitch**: In light of this, I’d like to be part of a high-trust, tight knit team of people committed to the primary objective of working together and supporting each other, while building high quality software products. As software professionals, I believe that we have a unique opportunity to work independently and in doing so to optimize for our long term enjoyment and satisfaction.

**Key Objectives**: On the surface, this does not appear to be different from the way any software business is started (i.e. find people to work with and attempt to build a profitable business). However, where I feel this is dramatically different is in the explicit goals and intentions of the team and as a result in the mindset of the team members.

In most software businesses, the goal is to build a successful product, to reach profitability, or to find a lucrative exit for the business. Instead, I’d like to focus on the following objectives:

- _Build Friendships_: Focus on building strong relationships within the team, based on established trust, mutual respect, and shared experiences. Supporting other team members as the need/opportunity arises, and of equal importance, allowing yourself to be supported by other team members will be crucial to achieve this.
- _Have Fun_: On the whole, our work should be extremely enjoyable. This will not be true of each individual activity, but should be true of the overwhelming majority of our work. If we’re not having fun, we’re doing it wrong.
- _Break Even_: Earn enough revenue to support reasonable, but not excessive, compensation, while investing in the development of new software products and opportunities to strengthen the team.

I feel that these objectives provide a helpful outline for the success of this endeavor, because a team that accomplishes only two of these objectives, regardless of which they are, would fail to achieve the long-term benefits and sense of satisfaction intended.

**Logistics**: The following is a rough outline of how this organization can potentially be structured, but is meant to serve as a representative example that will be adjusted to align with the needs and interests of the founding team members:

- _Team Setup_:
  - Initially the team would be composed in the following manner:
    - 3-5 partners (three seems like a sweet spot, particularly to get started)
    - All trusted partners with comparable levels of experience and strong working relationships
    - Each contributing equally (although not identically) and receiving an equal portion of the business’s profits
  - Down the road we may consider growing in the following ways:
    - Engage with subcontractors for specific projects
    - Hire non-partner employees with standard employment terms (i.e. annual salary, no share of profits, etc)
    - Promote employees to partners as it contributes to the core objectives and when agreed by the partner team that the individual is ready and a suitable team member (rarely)
    - It’s tough to imagine a case when a new partner would be brought in directly, given the level of compatibility, trust, and commitment this role requires.
  - It’s worth noting that growth is not a measurement of success and that success for this business could be that the founding team never changes.
  - The team should only grow in an attempt to support the core objectives (i.e. if it builds greater friendships, increases our enjoyment, or allows us to further invest in areas that support the other two objectives). 
- _Annual Salary_: $100k
- _Annual IRA Contribution_: $25k
- _Business Profits_: Split equally every three months
- _Financial Objectives_:
  - Generate $200k - $300k in annual revenue per-partner
    - For reference, this would be covered by billing for an average of 35 hours per week for 48 weeks of the year at a rate between $125 and $175, generating $210k to $294k.
    - However this is just a representative example and certainly could be covered by product revenue as well.
  - Target ~$200k in annual compensation per-partner (i.e. salary, retirement, profits, etc)
  - Budget ~$20k - $40k in annual expenses per-partner (e.g. healthcare, office space, equipment, travel, etc)
  - Reinvest additional profit into product and/or team development.
- _Ownership_:
  - Partners receive equal portions of equity on an annual basis.
  - This allows partners that have been with the company for longer and therefore invested more sweat equity into the business to own a larger portion of the business.
  - It’s not yet clear what type of equity would be used for this and how we would handle cases when a partner leaves the business. 
- _Benefits_:
  - Healthcare: TBD
  - Others: TBD
- _Collaboration/Team Building_:
  - Daily collaboration via Slack, email, Basecamp, etc
  - Initially all remote with the possibility of opening a physical office when appropriate.
  - Additional ideas:
    - Get together face-to-face on a quarterly basis (post COVID).
    - Use one such trip each year for a “team” offsite to do something or go somewhere as a group.
    - Use another such trip each year as a “family” offsite going somewhere and bringing along significant others and families.
- _Consulting Objectives_:
  - Engage in consulting projects to the degree required to support the Break Even objective and to reinvest sufficiently into product development initiatives
  - Execution steps worth considering:
    - Retain all of Harrison’s current consulting arrangements.
    - Reach out to all of Harrison’s current and previous consulting partners, offering additional support.
    - Reach out to all partner’s networks to source new consulting partners.
- _Product Development Objectives_:
  - Develop, deploy, and operate new products that we are interested in building.
Inspiration
  - [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook/): they have an open source playbook that outlines how their company is structured, etc. It’s super helpful. I also have a very good relationship with the Chief Design Officer at their company and may be willing to offer up some advice/ things to avoid.
  - [Anton Sten (Freelance Consultant)](https://www.antonsten.com): stumbled across this freelancer’s website and I really love the way it’s designed, structured, written, etc. Would love to take some inspiration for our future website. I especially like some of his FAQ, case studies, and writing. I would love to use blogging and writing as a way to initially stand out and build an audience, while also honing in on our core value proposition as consultants. 
  - [Superfriendly](https://superfriendlydesign.systems/about/): adding this because it’s a super (that one’s for you Truman) interesting and unique business model. It’s a consulting collective, focused on a very small niche, design systems.They also build [products](https://superbooked.com)!
  - [Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io/about/): I’ve always been impressed by the fact that Honeybadger was launched, and as I understand it scaled to a significant degree as a team of just the three co-founders. I’ve found this alone to be an impressive feat and one worth striving toward. Additionally I recently came across their freelanced approach to content creation ([see here](https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/write-for-us/)) and found it to be an approach that allowed them to increase the quantity of their content, while maintaining high quality, and a low team size.

**_Questions/Concerns_**
- Is this feasible/reasonable?
- In what scenarios do the assumptions of this business model break down (i.e. mutual trust, operating with one another’s best interests in mind, etc)?
- How would a partner leaving be handled?
- What type of equity would be used for ownership?
